name: Rahkdari

  _“Legends tell of a fearsome warlord whose mighty army and prowess with dark magic threatened to crush all who dared stand against him. Despite the fearsome warlord’s power, numerous tribes rallied together and stood against his tyranny. A decade of bloody war wrought devastation that tore the land asunder and yet, the warlord’s iron grasp on his new kingdom remained absolute._

  _The lucky among those rebel clans were broken and scattered to the winds, cast out from their homeland to find a new place in the world. Those who were unlucky were made examples of, so that none who looked upon their remains would dare challenge the warlord ever again. Yet, there were those who refused to relent; the pain of a thousand tortures was not enough to break their will._

  _Perhaps it was the determination in their hearts or the desperation of their cries, perhaps the ruin inflicted upon the land by the warlord had awakened that which had long slumbered. Perhaps it was the Warlord's own lust for power that angered the Great Spirit._

  _Though the reason remains unknown, what was clear was the tide of spirits that rose to confront the warlord, guiding those rebels who yet remained unbroken. They were changed, torn asunder and made whole once more. Spirits of Vengeance anchored to our world with mortal blood, and thus the first rahkdari were born.”_

  ## Description

  Children of both mortal and spiritual heritage, the rahkdari are uniquely spiritually sensitive wanderers that find themselves burdened with visions and whispers of the spirit world. To be rahkdari is to walk a careful balance between the mortal and the spiritual and a false step often comes at a steep price paid with insanity or even life itself. Rahkdari require spiritual nourishment the same as they may require food or sleep. To them, the need is as real as hunger or thirst and the consequences of neglect lead to the same disastrous outcomes. Rahkdari have three primary ways of feeding this hunger. Each of these methods leaves its mark on the rahkdari as the energies of the spirit world change and give rise to three unique bloodlines.
