description: |
  While this character is the Primary Ritualist of a Blood Magic Ritual, the total Life Point Cost is reduced by 1 for each Follower of Diavalla participating in the ritual. Alternatively, another character may receive a Deathblow as an additional cost of performing a Blood Magic Ritual, they may use their Total Life Points for the Life Point Cost. This will not interrupt the Ritual. Finally, a special Dark Territory Card is introduced into each Final Hand - this is not optional.
