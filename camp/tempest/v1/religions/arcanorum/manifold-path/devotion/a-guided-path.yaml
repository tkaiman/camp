    The Path sometimes deviates from our chosen fate - the Chosen may realign the fate of their allies by removing the negative consequences of ill fate and applying protective sigils to ward off further corruption.

    The caster may deliver a Touch cast to call “Cure [Condition] and Grant Protect vs Packets” on up to two allies, protecting them from harm.

    The first time this spell is cast each Long Rest it will not consume a spell slot.
