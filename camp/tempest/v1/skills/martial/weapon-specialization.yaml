  The character must choose from the following list: Shortsword, Longsword, Mace,
  Flail, Axe, Great Sword, Great Mace, Great Axe, Polearm, Bow, Crossbow, Thrown Weapon,
  Staff, or Dagger. After each Short Rest, the character gains one additional Spike that
  can only be used while the character is wielding a weapon of that type (although the
  actual attack need not come from that weapon). A character may only have Weapon
  Specialization with one weapon type.
