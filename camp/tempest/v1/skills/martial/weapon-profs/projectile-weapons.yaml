description: |
  The character has proficiency with projectile weapons.
  By aiming (Focusing) for a Quick 10 with their projectile weapon,
  the character can add their Spike damage without expending a Spike.
  If the character moves her right foot, or lowers her draw, the aiming
  will have to be done again to get the benefit. The character may not
  expend a Spike to further enhance her damage. By default, bows and
  crossbows take any damaging attack as a Shatter effect.
