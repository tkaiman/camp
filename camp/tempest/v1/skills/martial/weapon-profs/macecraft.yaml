description: |
  The character has a special skill with a mace and can use it to destroy shields.
  A mace is a special short weapon (22”-36”) that must have an obvious “head” and
  must have its center of balance closer to the head than the pommel.
  Each time the mace strikes a shield, the character can expend a Spike to do Shield-Breaking.
