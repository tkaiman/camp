cost: 2
description: |
  The character has some basic understanding of the way living creatures work
  and has some minor skill in the healing arts. By spending a Quick 100 tending
  to an individual, that individual, if dying, will become stable. The character’s
  death-count will not stop or pause while being tended to, so the target may die
  during the count. The character using this skill should role-play checking and
  binding wounds, and overall treating the character (please remember not to touch
  other players without explicit previous consent). The character using Basic Medicine
  may use any of the following at-will delivered by Touch: “Discern: Are you currently
  at max Life Points?”, “Discern: Are you Dying?” or “Discern: Are you Dead?”
