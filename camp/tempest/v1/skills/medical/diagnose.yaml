  With only a glance, the trained character can tell the extent of someone’s wounds.
  At-will the character can give a person a quick look over while within Touch range
  and then ask “Discern: How many Life Points are you down?” Additionally, after a
  thorough examination (please remember not to touch other players without explicit
  previous consent) you can determine what Conditions the character has. To do this
  use the call “Discern: What Conditions do you have currently?” This is delivered by Touch.
