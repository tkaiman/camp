description: |
  The character has mastered her chosen profession. She can perform the most
  complicated tasks and has a deep knowledge of lore associated with that mastery.
  The character’s mastery earns income represented by earning 6 Wealth at the beginning
  of each game, in addition to what they earn from their Apprentice and Journeyman skills.
  In addition, the character can choose one additional Profession-related Discern question
  and can ask it at-will (such as “Discern: Does this stone wall seem to be moveable?” for a mason).
  This question should be approved by Staff (between games).
