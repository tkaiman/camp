  # TODO(#15): One master-level spell slot
description: |
  Every spell for a single Base Class in the character’s spellbook is
  considered Prepared at all times. Any instances of Spell Preperation the
  character has may either be applied to another classes’ spell list, or can
  be refunded, as long as the character retains at least one instance of Spell Preperation.
