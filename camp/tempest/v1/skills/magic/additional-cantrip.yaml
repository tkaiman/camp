description: |
  The character can choose one additional Cantrip from their class’ Cantrip spell-list. If the character does not have a class spell-list, they may pick any Base Class Cantrip but the Cantrip must be from the same Sphere (Arcane or Divine) as the prerequisite that qualifies them for this skill.
