description: >
  The character can choose one additional cantrip from their class’ cantrip spell-list.
  If the character does not have a class spell-list, they may pick any cantrip but the
  cantrip must be from the same Sphere (Arcane or Divine) as the prerequisite that qualifies
  them for this skill.
