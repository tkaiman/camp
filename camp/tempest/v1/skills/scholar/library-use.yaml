name: Library Use
cost: 1
requires: basic-scholarship
description: |
  The character knows her way around a library and can find tomes, discover ancient texts,
  and generally learn things that are unavailable to the normal folk. This allows the
  character to discover additional information above and beyond what is normally available
  in Between Game Events, as long as a library is available and the information would be
  discoverable in books. If a Library exists in-game, the character may spend a 4-hour NPC
  shift researching any one question and will get an answer from Staff.
