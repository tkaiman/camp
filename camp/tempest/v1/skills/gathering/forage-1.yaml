name: Forage I
cost: 3
description: |
  The character can forage Bloom and Night Prizes from the wilderness. Bloom and Night Prizes may be laying on
  the ground individually, or may be part of a “patch” indicated either by some kind of container or an associated
  information card. A Forager should only take 1 from a patch per Event, unless there are instructions nearby to
  do otherwise.

  Anyone can see Bloom, Night Prizes and associated patches, but only those with the Forage skill can collect it
  (or do anything with it). In order to collect it, you must use a sickle or small bladed tool and roleplay for a
  Quick 30, slowly collecting up the bundle of Bloom or Night Prizes. The character can Forage up to 15 Bloom and
  7 Night Prizes per Event. In addition, certain resources are gated behind each rank of this skill, allowing those
  with greater proficiency to gather more difficult to obtain resources.
