  The character gets flashes of help from the beyond that can help in times of need.
  The character can call out to some great power, such as the Gods, the Light, or any
  other greater or divine creature, and ask for a flash of insight to help with a mental
  puzzle or riddle. If there is an NPC nearby who can be briefly possessed by the power
  called for, she will blurt out a short hint or helpful piece of advice, but be totally
  unaware that they have done so.

  The insight cannot talk about the future, nor speculate about actions. The incantation
  for this should be along the lines of “Hear me O Light, and grant me the boon of Insight!”
  This can be done once per Long Rest for each time this Perk is purchased. Regardless of
  how many times Insight has been purchased, it cannot be used more than once per Short Rest.
  All uses return after a Long Rest.
