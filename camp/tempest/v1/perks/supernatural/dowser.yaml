description: |
  A dowser can try and find certain locations by using a dowsing device of some kind to tune
  her natural psychic power. This might be a simple forked stick, a pair of bent metal copper
  wires, or something similar personal to the character. A character with this power can choose
  to try and find mines, wells, deposits, or other special locations. The player must contact
  Staff in order to use this ability and will be given clues, maps, or descriptions of places
  to find what she is looking for. The player may use this once per long rest.
