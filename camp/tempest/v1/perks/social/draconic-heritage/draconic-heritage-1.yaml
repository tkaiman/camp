description: |
  The character has dragon ancestors. This manifests in a number of ways and the character’s
  draconic blood can express itself more as the character rises in level. The character should
  choose from Lightning, Flame, Ice, or Acid. In addition to the following benefits, dragons
  can sense the character’s blood as can, occasionally, dragon-related creatures such as kobolds.

  The character can counter one attack of the appropriate Accent by calling “Counter”. She can do
  this once per Short Rest. The character is affected by Powers that affect Dragons.
