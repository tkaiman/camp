  Some bonds are not love, or even a bond-pair but are, instead, a group of people who
  share some common purpose or mystical link. When a character takes this Perk, she names
  up to three other characters. She gets the benefits of this Perk only with those named members.
  They should be confirmed during game to avoid mistakes. With those individuals, the character

  * This Character can use “Discern: How many Life Points are you down?” to any other member of the group at-will.

  * This Character may Cure any one of the following Conditions: Berserk, Charmed, or Dominated, with the call “Cure [Condition] by Bond.” This may be used once per Long Rest per named member.
