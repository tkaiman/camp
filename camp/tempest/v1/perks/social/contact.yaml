  You have a friend or ally who knows things. Choose two areas of Lore that your Contact
  has expertise in. Once per Event, you can write a note or letter to this contact and
  include a few Wealth and Staff will answer for your Contact with clues, information, or
  additional hints. The helpfulness of this information will depend on whether the questions
  match the Contact’s Lore skills as well as the bribe sent. The player should create a name
  and simple backstory for the Contact and why that Contact would answer questions.
