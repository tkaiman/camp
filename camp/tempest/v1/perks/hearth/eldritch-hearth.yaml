  When the character creates an Arcane Hearth, she may spend an additional minute or so
  on the rite, constructing or assembling a simple crystal focus that must produce light.
  If a named member of the Hearth conducts an Arcane Ritual within the confines of the Hearth,
  the amount of Dark Territory is reduced by one.
