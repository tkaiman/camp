description: |
  The character possesses the secret of the Fairy Orchestra. Most of these are actual orchestras
  made up of willing or bound fae, trapped inside a mystically prepared box or other object.
  Others are demonic in nature, or even simply magical artifacts. A Fairy Orchestra can allow those
  designated by the owner to whom it is bound, to summon soft music to add ambiance or for entertainment.
  The Orchestra will not play if the character does not have a designated Hearth.

  This allows the player to use a musical device to play appropriate, in-period music. The music must be
  soft enough so it cannot easily be heard outside the character’s Hearth. The music must use real instruments,
  and cannot have lyrics that will break game immersion. The Fairy Orchestra cannot be removed from the Hearth
  without express staff approval.
