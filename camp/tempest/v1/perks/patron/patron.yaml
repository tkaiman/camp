  The character is under the patronage of a powerful supernatural creature. This may be a Fae Lady,
  a god or goddess, a Great Power, an elder demon, or any other creature of significant mystical
  strength. The character has some sort of relationship with their Patron, whether it be servile,
  romantic, or purely business. The character can never refuse a request by that patron without
  losing this Perk. The character has a relationship with this patron and can make requests or
  prayers to it, although there is no necessity that they be answered or honored. Most other Perks
  can be purchased more cheaply if they are granted (and thus revocable) by the Patron. Any Perk
  that doesn’t have the Patron prerequisite that is going to be considered a gift from the Patron
  costs 1 CP less (to a minimum of 1).  The Patron perk may provide a maximum of 10 CP in discounts.
