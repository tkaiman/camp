description: >
  The character’s patron, often a war or death deity, or some other similar greater power,
  has given the character the ability to destroy those who would end the patron’s beloved pet.
  Once per Event, when the character is Deathblowed or killed with a melee attack, she can do
  damage to the one who attacked her. The cost of this Perk depends on the amount of damage the
  character does when killed. At higher power levels, this Perk can do damage “By My Voice”
  instead. Whether the individual or By My Voice damage is done is up to the character at the
  time it is used. The Accent on the damage is “by Spite”. Note that in the case of a Deathblow,
  the Hateful Retribution will go off before the character actually dies.
