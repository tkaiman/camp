description: |
  The character is naturally agile and well-balanced. In any repped situation where the
  character might lose her balance or fall, or would generally be saved by agility, she
  should be given the widest possible interpretation. For example, if jumping from column
  to column, she only gets the tips of her toes onto the column. This would normally cause
  a fall, but because the character is agile, she is judged to have managed the jump. This
  will not make impossible things possible, or outright break rules for physical obstacles.
