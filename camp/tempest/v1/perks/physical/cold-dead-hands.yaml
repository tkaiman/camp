name: Cold Dead Hands
cost: 3
description: |
  The character will not involuntarily let go of their own possessions at any time,
  even when Slept, Dying, or even Dead. The player should call “Cold Dead Hands” whenever
  someone tries to remove a possession from the character's hand. If the character’s arm is
  Disabled, she will not release her possessions (although she cannot use them or block with them).
  If the character’s weapon is Disarmed, the character will take a Disable Effect to that limb
  instead of the same Duration as was Called for the Disarm (or a Quick Count of 30 if no duration is Called)
