description: |
  Usually as the result of a dalliance with a member of the fair folk, the character
  is affected by Powers that have the “to Fae/Fairy” qualifier. In addition, the character
  takes 1 point of damage by Agony every time she speaks a statement she believes to be
  false and treats all Powers that require or detect truth as Final.
