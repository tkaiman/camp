award: 2
description: |
  For whatever reason, the character is bound to speak no lies.
  It may be a curse, or divine intervention, or a magical promise that has become binding.
  This means that the character is incapable of speaking a statement that she knows is
  false for the purposes of deceiving another. Written falsehoods are not covered by this
  Flaw, nor are spoken jokes and jests not meant to be taken seriously. If the player realizes
  that her character has lied, the character immediately takes Final damage equal to her Life
  Point total and she begins dying. Taking this Flaw reduces the Award for Fae Blood by 1.
