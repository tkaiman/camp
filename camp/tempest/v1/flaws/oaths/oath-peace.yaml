name: Binding Oath of Peace
award: 5
description: |
  At some time in the past, the character made a binding oath of peace.
  The reasons for this oath, and for its powerfully magical binding, are up to the player.
  The character is required to obey the strictures as best as they can, and should the player
  realize that the character has broken the rules, she will lose access to her highest level
  Powers and will take a 1 point penalty to her maximum Life Point total. These will last until
  the character feels she has atoned for her failures in-game. Binding Oaths that are imposed
  by Staff require Staff approval for atonement.

  The Oath of Peace is as follows:

  * You cannot intentionally end any sentient life.
  * You cannot attack another sentient creature except in self defense
  * You cannot allow a life to be ended.
