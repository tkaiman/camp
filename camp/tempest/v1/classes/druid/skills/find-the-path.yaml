description: |
  Upon using this power, the character may ask the trees what they have seen,
  and follow specific paths. They can see and follow green flags marked with a
  white circle (called a “Halo”) until they have finished a Short Rest. This
  Power must be cast while within Touch range of a tree of any size, but its
  benefits may be used anywhere.

  If the Druid later purchases the Tracking Skill, they may refund this skill.
