  After many hours spent honing and perfecting their craft, the Artisan has found certain shortcuts
  and efficiencies in the everyday Plans they create. Choose one Craft: Alchemy, Arcane Ritual Magic,
  Divine Ritual Magic, Enchanting, or Tinkering. While producing their chosen craft, the Artisan may
  call “Studied Process” at the beginning of their crafting attempt to reduce all mentions of “turns
  of the hourglass” by half, to a minimum of one half turn of the hourglass per mention. This power
  may be purchased more than once, choosing another craft each time.

  **Note**: This Power stacks with other time reduction skills for crafting, however, no
  repetitions / turns can be reduced below 1 each.
