description: |
  This Power can only be used out of combat with another Individual and, ideally, should be
  done in private. The Artisan connects themself to the emotions of the other sitting in
  silence with them for at least a minute. After the minute, the Artisan should describe their
  own emotional state in honest, descriptive terms. They should not convey facts other than
  about how they feel (i.e. “I feel hurt and betrayed” rather than “Because Triss ended up
  taking Tymera on his quest instead of me, I feel hurt and betrayed”).

  When they feel they have fully described their feelings, they should Call “Divine: How do you
  feel right now?” The target should then describe their emotional state. After this sharing,
  until the end of the Event, the Artisan can, once, Cure that character of Dominated, Charmed,
  or any Condition caused by an emotion-based Accent (by Terror, by Fear, by Rage) as a Verbal
  Effect. The Artisan can only have the power to Cure any one individual once at any one time
  (i.e. Share cannot be used multiple times on the same individual to stack the curing effect.)
