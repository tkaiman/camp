description: |
  Normally when an Enchanter creates a scroll using the Scribe Novice Scroll formulae they must
  use Simple Ink to write the words of the scroll. The Artisan has gained the ability to ignore
  the alchemical part of this process and through their own blood scribe the magics onto the
  hide. Using Blood Scroll the Artisan can ignore the need for Simple Ink for up to 2 scrolls
  when they use Scribe Novice Scroll by Sacrificing 1 Life Point of blood. Sometimes certain
  beings may be attracted to Artisans that use this process, but perhaps that is only rumor.

  **Note**: When turning in resources used for the Scribe Novice Scroll to the Ashbin, the
  player should include a small note with the character’s name, and the name of this power.
