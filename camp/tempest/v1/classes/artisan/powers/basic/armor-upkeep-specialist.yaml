description: |
  The Artisan can alter the creation of a Field Patch Kit they are crafting. If this process is
  used, the resulting creation is called a "Specialist Field Patch Kit" with an expiration of 1
  year. This item, once per Long Rest, is not consumed on use when the Artisan personally uses
  it and mends the armor to full instead of the normal amount. If any other person uses the
  item it is consumed as normal. If this Power is lost or removed, the Specialist Field Patch
  Kit will only function as a standard Patch Kit. Maintaining the Specialist Field Patch Kit
  requires dedicated attention, thus the Artisan may only have 1 at a time.

  The item’s card must be updated with these special features.
