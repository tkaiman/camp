description: |
  The Artisan looks over the mystic lines that make up the Glyph, pulling each apart for
  special meaning and nuance, focusing for a Quick Count of 100. The Artisan should then go to
  the Glyph information card and read as much as they can from the back. While they are doing
  this, they will not activate the Glyph. If they take any other actions (trying to go through
  a door, open a box, answer questions, etc.) then the Glyph will trigger normally (if they are
  doing something that would trigger it).
