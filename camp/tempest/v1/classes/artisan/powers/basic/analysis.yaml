description: |
  The Artisan can inspect any item that has an information card for a Quick Count of
  100 and then read the information card. This will not make the character immune to
  any Effects or consequences (reading a Glyph item card, for example, may mean the
  Artisan is close enough to set off the Glyph). If there is a Player Guide available,
  the Player Guide may be asked to give the properties of any item, including ones
  that do not have information cards, but the information given is up to the attending
  Player Guide.

  **Note**: This power will reveal only the information available on the card, and additional effects may exist that are obfuscated.
