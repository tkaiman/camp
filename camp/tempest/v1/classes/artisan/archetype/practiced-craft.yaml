  The Artisan gains an additional rank of the Fortunate Finder skill.

  If the Artisan has more [Crafter] tagged powers than any other type, has at
  least 9 [Crafter] tagged Artisan powers (Basic, Advanced, Utility), and
  possesses the pre-requisite Journeyman skill the Artisan also gains one of the
  following for free:

  * Greater Alchemy (5)
  * Greater Enchanting (5)
  * Greater Tinkering (5)

  **Note**: This allows the Artisan to gain a Greater crafting skill one level
  earlier than would normally be available.
