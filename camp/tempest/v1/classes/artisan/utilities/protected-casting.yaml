  When casting a ritual, the Artisan is shrouded by a magic circle.
  The circle is only big enough to encompass the Artisan themself,
  to a maximum size of 3 feet in diameter. The circle dissipates
  immediately when the ritual ends. Once the circle is up, the
  Artisan gains a number of Counters vs Weapons equal to their
  Artisan class-level. These protections will prevent disruption of
  the ritual by weapon delivered damage and effects - the Artisan
  need only say “Counter, Protected Casting” when struck to
  acknowledge the attack, but the ritual remains undisrupted.

  These defenses are lost when the circle dissipates. The Artisan
  is responsible for providing the physical representation of this,
  otherwise the circle does not form.
