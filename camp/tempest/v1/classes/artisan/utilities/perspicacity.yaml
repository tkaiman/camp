description: |
  The Artisan can examine a particular foe intently while Focusing to
  try and determine its weaknesses. Note that in mass melees and high
  pressure/speed situations, it may be impossible to Discern things
  properly and no or erroneous answers may occur. Note that
  vulnerability is a Condition, so unless the target has a specific
  vulnerability Condition, the answer will come back as “None.”
