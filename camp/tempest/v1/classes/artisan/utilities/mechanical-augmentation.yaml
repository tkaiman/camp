  Once per Power per Long Rest, when the Artisan targets themselves with a Basic or Advanced
  Artisan power that would require expending a Forgesource, they may instead spend a Spike.

  In addition, after a Short Rest, the Artisan may gain a Protect from one of the following:
  Poison, Agony, or Fear. As long as they have this Protect they are Inherently Slowed.

  Finally, the Artisan gains the “Construct” and “Automaton” Qualifiers (not the Type), which
  makes them subject to calls with those targets.

  **For Example**: “5 To Construct by Time” would affect the Artisan.
