  The Artisan gains the skill Apprentice Tinkering (3).

  The Artisan knows the power of creation itself: the power of Forgesources.
  An Artisan with this power may craft two Forgesources at the same time.

  Additionally, the Artisan may make Forgesources when they are only an Apprentice
  Tinker rather than the normal requirement of being a Journeyman Tinker.

  Finally, the Artisan may replace any Uncommon resource (Rare Minerals, Harvest,
  Night Prizes) in a Tinkering Schematic with a Forgesource at-will.
