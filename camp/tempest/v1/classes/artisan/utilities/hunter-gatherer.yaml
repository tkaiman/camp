  The Artisan gains their next rank of Foraging ignoring any Level prerequisites,
  if this would put the character over three ranks, they are instead refunded a
  rank.

  The Artisan is used to walking the land looking for bloom and night prizes.
  Sometimes they even need to defend themselves from threats encountered in the
  wilderness. After picking up at least 1 Bloom or 1 Night Prize through the
  Foraging skill the Artisan gets +1 to Maximum Spike Damage on their next melee
  or ranged attack that uses a Spike.

  Additionally, the Artisan may take an additional Night Prize from a "mushroom
  patch" for every rank of Foraging they possess, this will not allow them to go
  over the limit of Night Prizes they may collect per Event, but does allow them
  to gather more than the 1 they are normally limited to.

  ### CMA Notes

  Only Forage I will be granted, but the character will receive the appropriate refund
  if it is already known so that you can buy Forage II or Forage III instead. If you
  have this power, the level requirement for Forage III is waived.
