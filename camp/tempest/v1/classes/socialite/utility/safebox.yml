  This box can then be used to hold items that might be part of a deal, and the contents will be generally unreachable unless both parties agree that it should be opened. After a few moments of tinkering, the Socialite can set a box so that the next time it is closed, it will become a Safebox. The Socialite will need an item information card from a Tinkering Station to add to the box. The maximum dimensions of this vault should be no more than 2’x2’x3’. The box gains Inherent Shatter immunity.

  The card should be marked with a black keyhole Sigil and attached to the box. Around the keyhole should be written, “Only opens once both [Name #1] touches the box and says, ‘_Open_’ and [Name #2] touches the box and says, ‘_Open_.’ Each Name should be checked off when this occurs.” The two people that are named must be present when the box is created. The Socialite may be one of these names.

  Additionally, the Tinkering recipe “General Forged Item” may be used to create unique keys that can be consumed in the creation of the Safebox to add additional names to the Information Card.

  **Note**: This effect may be removed by certain Powers, such as Dispel Magic, or the Ritual Disjunction, etc..
