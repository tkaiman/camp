  The Socialite is familiar with the ways and means of many puzzles, be it by book education, or a more practical one. They gain the Insight Perk.

  In addition, once per Long Rest, the Socialite may ask of a nearby Spirit if there is a practical timed aspect to the situation they are in, such as a timer that resets their work, or an amount of time the puzzle must be completed in.

  In addition, the Socialite may ask a Spirit if an action they are about to take is likely to end disastrously once per Long Rest.
