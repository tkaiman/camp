name: Traveling Merchant
description: |
  The Socialite can call upon a merchant and persuade them to make a stop so the Socialite can trade with them. The Socialite must send correspondence in advance so the merchant can adjust their travels accordingly. To use this power, the Socialite must send a letter out by the end of the event for the merchant to show up at the next event. They can choose one from the following list: General Goods, Ritual Supplies, Tinkerer Supplies, Alchemical Supplies, Enchanting Supplies, Raw Materials, and Specialty Goods.

  When the merchant shows, they will seek out a common place of commerce, and will allow the Socialite that called them first right of refusal on the first round of sales. If, for whatever reason, the merchant is unable to show, the Socialite may simply arrive at Check-In and receive the opportunity to purchase there and then, by themselves.

  Finally, the Traveling Merchant may be commissioned to sell goods on behalf of the Socialite as a consignment sale, negotiated at the time the Merchant arrives in town.

  The Socialite should be aware that particularly good sales by the merchant might incline them to tip the Socialite, but that’s up to individual roleplay.
