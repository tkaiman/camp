  The Socialite has mastered their trade and expanded their business throughout the region. They gain the Profession - Master skill.

  In addition, they have the complete support of a small caravan who will take them wherever they would like, so long as they are willing to flex their chosen trade or charismatic acumen for them from time to time.
