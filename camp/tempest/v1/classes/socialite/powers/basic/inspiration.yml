description: |
  A Socialite may speak with members of a group that they are the "Heart" of and grant them 2 Barrier once per Short rest. Alternatively, once per Long Rest, the Socialite may instead Refresh a Novice Spell-Slot once per each member of the group.

  The Socialite's roleplay may be any suitably motivating activity including a rousing speech, a back and forth discussion of battle tactics, a sermon, an assurance of purpose, a group hug (remember physical consent rules), or a heart to heart where the socialite explains how much the targets of the ability all mean to the Socialite. Regardless of the type of roleplay, it requires attention and focus from all members looking to receive the benefits.
