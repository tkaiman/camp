description: |
  As a master of poisons, the Socialite knows the best defense against such poisons. They have developed their own potent brew that helps negate such negative effects. The Socialite lines up a round of shots of their own brew and gathers up to 6 people round the table.

  Each person who consumes the viscous brew gains a Protect vs Will, Fear, and Poison by Poison as the liquid coats the inside of each person’s stomach and sturdies their mind.
