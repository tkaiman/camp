description: |
  The fine art of masking one’s true feelings is a long and practiced skill for every charming Socialite, as it could easily mean the difference between a bargain struck or one falling through, whether a simple trade agreement, or a diplomatic parlay on the field of battle. The Socialite is able, through their fierce will alone, to curtail the reading of their features and tells for a while, leaving those who would learn their inner turmoil unable.

  The Socialite becomes Obfuscated to the Discern effect for a number of times equal to their Socialite class-level. When responding to the Discern effect, the Socialite may answer however they choose. You do not need to announce you are using this Power and this Power can be used against Subtle Discerns even if the character is unaware of the Discern Effect.
