  When pressed into combat, the Socialite is best able to serve while heavily guarded and calling the shots from the back. Quick wit and their observant nature are the cornerstones of the Socialite’s battlefield prowess. Weaving inspiring words to benefit their allies is what they do best.

  The Socialite may use the following abilities to grant boons by expending a Spike:

  * “[Name or Description] Short Grant +1 to Spike Damage by Will”
  * “[Name or Description] Mend 3 Armor by Will”
  * “[Name or Description] Heal 1 by Will”
  * “[Name or Description] Grant Protect vs Packets by Will”

  This power ends when the Socialite completes a Short Rest, or has given out a number of boons equal to their Socialite class-level.
