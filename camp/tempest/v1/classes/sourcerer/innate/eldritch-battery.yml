description: |
  The Sourcerer can meditate and commune with the Weave to rebuild focus and refresh their spell slots. The Sourcerer can spend a Short Rest reconnecting with the weave of ley-lines that lay just beneath the fabric of reality.

  Between Long Rests, the Sourcerer can refresh a number of Arcane Novice spell-slots equal to two times their total levels in their Arcane-casting Classes. This power may be used to refresh spells from any of this character’s Arcane spellcasting classes, but this power does not stack with similar powers from those classes.

  This can be done in any increment and the Sourcerer can refresh a Arcane Adept spell-slot in the place of two Arcane Novice spell-slots. Greater spell-slots take the place of three Novice spell-slots, and Master spell-slots take the place of four Novice spell-slots.

  Additional benefits come if this Power is used in an area of concentrated magical power (such as an Arcane Locus), with a personal rite (determined by the Sourcerer). Up to three times per Long Rest, if the Sourcerer uses this Power in that way, they can Refresh a Arcane Novice spell-slot that does not count toward the total Refresh limit between Long Rests. This may occur in addition to Refreshing other spell-slots as normal.
