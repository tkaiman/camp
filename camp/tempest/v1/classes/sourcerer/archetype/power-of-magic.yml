description: |
  The Sourcerer’s channeling of magic through the Eldritch Source allows them to make sacrifices other more traditional arcane casters cannot.

  During any Long Rest, the Sourcerer may Sacrifice a Cantrip that they know, other than Cancel, losing the ability to cast it, until their next Long Rest. In exchange, the Sourcerer gains +1 Spike Damage, until their next Long Rest.

  This Spike Damage Bonus only applies to Spells from the Sourcerer Spell list and cannot be applied to any other usage of Spikes.

  In all cases, the normal stacking rules apply to these Spike Damage bonuses.
