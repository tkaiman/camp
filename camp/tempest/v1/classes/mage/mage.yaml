  The Mage is truly a power to be reckoned with. Their offensive magic is effective and lethal
  and their defensive magic is some of the most potent available. There are few classes that
  compare to a high level Mage and Mages always command both fear and respect from their adversaries.
  They are the disciples of power.

  Mage comes from the Latin word “Magus,” which means magician. Originally, the term meant "learned man."
  This was especially applied to the Persian scholars of the first century B.C.E. These men were the
  most advanced scientists of the time and were revered for their wisdom and literacy. Magi has also
  been used, in its learned or wise man sense, to speak of the kings that came to visit Christ at his
  birth. It was J.R.R. Tolkien that gave the fantasy mage its real birth. Although Arthurian legend
  has the strong character of Merlin, a half-fairy wizard of almost unlimited power, it is Gandalf
  that followed and who ultimately claimed the wizard's place in fantasy literature for all time.

  The Mage is a strong addition to any team. Mages have a number of enchantments and spells that can
  help add to a team's strength and effectiveness. The Mage's power trade-off is tightly restricted
  weaponry and light armor in return for particularly potent defensive magic. They tend to be back-line
  combatants, as their abilities rarely allow them the capability to stand up to well-armed and armored
  warrior classes. With the right warrior back-up though, the Mage can become a truly devastating force.

  Wizards are most often thought of in long robes inscribed with arcane symbols. Flowing cloaks and
  robes are good garb for a Mage character and as for weapon choice, staff is always a good pick.

  The Mage is an Arcane spell-caster. The Mage should choose a special symbol that is their caster-sigil
  and mark their spellbook and packets with it.

    > “I conjure words of arcane might, from studied tomes in candlelight,
    > I draw my strength from sky and land. Gather now within my hand.
    > From planes beyond, my power's Source, By Word and Will I give it force.
    > My Word as law, my Will supreme, I fuse the strength of truth and dream…”
