description: |
  When the Laernian Bottle is used, the Mage must come to a stop and place both hands across their
  chest. When struck by an opponent's melee attack, the Mage may call out “[Name or Description]
  Piercing [X] by Flame”, where the target is the foe that struck the Mage, and the amount of damage
  is equal to the number of times the Mage has been struck since the spell was cast. The power ends
  when the Mage completes a short rest, falls unconscious, uses another power, or moves their right
  foot or hands (other than for safety).

  **Note**: The Mage gains no protection from this spell, but is allowed to use protections and
  defenses that have already been cast.
