  A creature stuck by the spell has the named item or item held by the named limb
  forcibly removed and dropped to the ground. If the specified equipment is a shield
  (or the limb is wearing a shield) the arm must be straightened so that it is pointing
  directly at the ground to allow the shield to slide off the arm if possible. Unlike
  other Effects, if no duration is called, the duration of Disarm is Instantaneous, and
  the item may be picked up immediately upon hitting the ground.
