effect: Wounding
description: |
  This spell must be cast while inside a white cord, rope, or the like that is
  no longer than 10 feet long that has been laid down to make a continuous shape
  (usually a circle). At the completion of the Incantation, the lain rope cannot
  be purposefully moved until the caster picks it up. This should be
  communicated to others trying to touch or manipulate it. As long as the caster
  has both feet inside the circle (regardless of whether they have remained in
  the circle), they can charge a spell-ball with elemental energy by calling
  “Spell-ball Charged”. Only one spell ball may be charged at a time with this spell.

  The ball will cause 2 points of Wounding Acid / Flame / Ice / Lightning Damage.
  The Mage may charge a number of Spell-Balls with this spell equal to their Mage
  class-level. The Mage can continue to do this until they complete a Short Rest
  or until the circle is moved, broken, or Dispelled. Incidental/accidental movement
  of the circle will not disturb the spell (such as a foot moving the cord accidentally).
