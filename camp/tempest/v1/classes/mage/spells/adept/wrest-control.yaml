description: |
  Calling upon their deep understandings of the Weave, the Mage can intuit
  the mystical pathways used in the generation of constructs, and attempt
  to override them, gaining control. The Mage weaves mystic sigils in the
  air binding the strands of eldritch energy animating the golem, verbalizing
  their intent, and the construct is tethered to their will… for a time.
