description: |
  Bolster Shield adds a sheath of magical power around up to three shields, giving them
  additional hardness, adding 2 shield-points to the touched shields. This can take a
  shield above its maximum Shield Points. These points will last only until lost (i.e.
  they cannot be Mended) or until the shield’s user completes a Short Rest. This spell
  will not work on a shield that has been Shattered. Each instance of this spell must
  target a different shield.
