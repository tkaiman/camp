description: |
  The Mage reaches out with their will, putting into others a deep compulsion to stay away.
  Upon completion of the incantation, two spell-balls will be charged with the ability to Repel
  others. If this spell is Prepared using an Adept spell-slot, four balls are charged. If it is
  cast with a Greater spell-slot, it charges a single spell-packet, but gives the Mage the
  ability to continue casting the spell as if it were a cantrip until the next Short Rest.
  Although multiple spell-balls are charged at once, they must be thrown one at a time.
