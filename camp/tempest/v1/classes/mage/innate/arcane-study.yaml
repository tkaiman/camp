name: Arcane Study
requires: mage:1
description: |
  The Mage can meditate and commune with the Weave to rebuild focus and refresh their spell slots.
  The Mage can spend a Short Rest studying their spell-book, making notes on spells, or practicing their incants quietly.

  Between Long Rests, the Mage can refresh a number of Arcane Novice spell-slots equal to two
  times their total levels in their Arcane-casting Classes. This power may be used to refresh spells
  from any of this character’s Arcane spellcasting classes, but this power does not stack with similar
  powers from those classes.

  This can be done in any increment and the Mage can refresh a Arcane Adept spell-slot in the place of
  two Arcane Novice spell-slots. Greater spell-slots take the place of three Novice spell-slots, and
  Master spell-slots take the place of four Novice spell-slots.

  Additional benefits come if this Power is used in an area of concentrated magical power (such as an
  Arcane Locus), with a personal rite (determined by the Mage). Up to three times per Long Rest, if the
  Mage uses this Power in that way, they can Refresh a Arcane Novice spell-slot that does not count
  toward the total Refresh limit between Long Rests. This may occur in addition to Refreshing other
  spell-slots as normal.
