description: |
    If your form is hidden by appropriate clothing, you may circumvent attempts to expose your location. You must be masked and hooded to use this skill, and you cannot have any skin showing except for the eye holes or eye slit in your mask or cowl. While you are dressed this way, you may expend a Spike to gain Obfuscate vs Expose once. As with all Obfuscate powers, you do not need to announce when you are using this power.
